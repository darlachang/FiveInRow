Instructions for interacting with your GUI:
	Select a controller type from each JComboBox
	Click JButton when ready
	For Human controller, click the box for your turn
		
Any known bugs or shortcomings in your submission:
	For Human controller, make careful clicks.
	Be sure to hover over desired box, then quickly click.
	If you do a sloppy click by accidentally dragging, the GUI may lag when marking the square.

Any additional design or implementation notes that you think are interesting
	Board is hidden until the user chooses two controllers.
	After the controllers are submitted, the JComboBoxes are hidden.
	We pride ourselves on our UX decision: showing relevant components, hiding irrelevant ones.

Feedback:
	We were foolish to think we could do this the night before.
	We know you stressed starting early a million times. 
	It was not enough.
